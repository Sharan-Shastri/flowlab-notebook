abstract = {The paper addresses the problem associated with the optimal wind park design. A combinatorial optimization model for wind turbines type and number choice and placement considering the given wind conditions and wind park area is developed. The wind park investment costs and the total power relation as function of wind turbines number and type are used as optimization criteria. The optimization problem is formulated as a single criterion mixed-integer nonlinear discrete combinatorial task. The different wind park conditions are introduced into optimization tasks formulation as variables relations and restrictions. Two basic wind directions cases are taken into consideration - uniform and predominant wind directions for two wind park area shapes - square and rectangular. The developed wind park design approach was tested numerically by solving of different optimization tasks formulations based on wind turbines real parameters data. The numerical testing shows the applicability of the developed optimization approach. Using it will help to find mathematically reasoned wind turbines choice as contradiction to the heuristic approaches. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The quantification of uncertainty in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) predictions is both a significant challenge and an important goal. Probabilistic uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods have been used to propagate uncertainty from model inputs to outputs when input uncertainties are large and have been characterized chaos (PC) methods have found increased use in probabilistic UQ over the past decade. This review describes the use of PC expansions for the representation of random variables/fields and discusses their utility for the propagation of uncertainty in computational models, focusing on CFD models. Many CFD applications are considered, including flow in porous media, incompressible and compressible flows, and thermofluid and reacting flows. The review examines each application area, focusing on the demonstrated use of PC UQ and the associated challenges. Cross-cutting challenges with time unsteadiness and long time horizons are also discussed.},

abstract = {Understanding of power losses and turbulence increase due to wind turbine wake interac- tions in large offshore wind farms is crucial to optimizing wind farm design. Power losses and turbulence increase due to wakes are quantified based on observations from Middel- grunden and state-of-the-art models. Observed power losses due solely to wakes are approximately 10{\%} on average. These are relatively high for a single line of wind turbines due in part to the close spacing of the wind farm.The wind farm model Wind Analysis and Application Program (WAsP) is shown to capture wake losses despite operating beyond its specifications for turbine spacing. The paper describes two methods of estimating turbu- lence intensity: one based on the mean and standard deviation (SD) of wind speed from the nacelle anemometer, the other from mean power output and its SD.Observations from the nacelle anemometer indicate turbulence intensity which is around 9{\%} higher in absolute terms than those derived from the power measurements. For comparison, turbu- lence intensity is also derived from wind speed and SD from a meteorological mast at the same site prior to wind farm construction.Despite differences in the measurement height and period, overall agreement is better between the turbulence intensity derived from power measurements and the meteorological mast than with those derived from data from the nacelle anemometers.The turbulence in wind farm model indicates turbulence increase of the order 20{\%} in absolute terms for flow directly along the row which is in good agree- ment with the observations},

abstract = {The optimum wind farm configuration problem is discussed in this paper and an evolutive algorithm to optimize the wind farm layout is proposed. The algorithm's optimization process is based on a global wind farm cost model using the initial investment and the present value of the yearly net cash flow during the entire wind-farm life span. The proposed algorithm calculates the yearly income due to the sale of the net generated energy taking into account the individual wind turbine loss of production due to wake decay effects and it can deal with areas or terrains with non-uniform load-bearing capacity soil and different roughness length for every wind direction or restrictions such as forbidden areas or limitations in the number of wind turbines or the investment. The results are first favorably compared with those previously published and a second collection of test cases is used to proof the performance and suitability of the proposed evolutive algorithm to find the optimum wind farm configuration. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A multi-objective genetic algorithm approach is employed to obtain optimal placement of wind turbines by maximizing the power production capacity while constraining the budget of installed turbines. Considering the speed and direction history, wind with constant intensity from a single direction is used during optimization. This study is based on wake deficit model mainly because of its simplicity, accuracy and fast calculation time. The individuals of the Pareto optimal solution set are evaluated with respect to various criteria, and the best configurations are presented. In addition to best placement layouts, results include objective function values, total power output, cost and number of turbines for each configuration.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a multi-fidelity (MF) extension of non-intrusive polynomial chaos based on regression (point collocation) for uncertainty quantification purposes. The proposed method uses the principle of a global correction function from a previous similar method that uses spectral projection to estimate the coefficients. Due to its usage of regression to estimate the coefficients, the present method offers high flexibility in the sampling and generation of the polynomial basis. The method takes advantage of a nested sampling plan to create the samples for the low-fidelity (LF) and correction expansions where the high-fidelity (HF) samples are a subset of the LF ones. To build the polynomial basis, a total order or hyperbolic truncation strategy is used with a highly flexible combination of the LF and correction polynomial expansions. The method is demonstrated on some artificial test problems and aerodynamic problems of the Euler flow around an airfoil and common three-dimensional research models. In order to derive the strategies for successful MF approximation, the effect of the correlation and the errors between the LF and HF functions is also studied. The results show that high correlation and moderately low errors are important to improve the MF approximation's accuracy. On a common research model problem, the MF approach with partially-converged simulations as the LF samples can successfully reduce the computational cost to about 40{\%} for similar accuracy compared to an approach using a single HF expansion.},

abstract = {An efficient method for uncertainty analysis of flow in random porous media is explored in this study, on the basis of combination of Karhunen-Loeve expansion and probabilistic collocation method (PCM). The random log transformed hydraulic conductivity field is represented by the Karhunen-Loeve expansion and the hydraulic head is expressed by the polynomial chaos expansion. Probabilistic collocation method is used to determine the coefficients of the polynomial chaos expansion by solving for the hydraulic head fields for different sets of collocation points. The procedure is straightforward and analogous to the Monte Carlo method, but the number of simulations required in PCM is significantly reduced. Steady state flows in saturated random porous media are simulated with the probabilistic collocation method, and comparisons are made with other stochastic methods: Monte Carlo method, the traditional polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) approach based on Galerkin scheme, and the moment-equation approach based on Karhunen-Loeve expansion (KLME). This study reveals that PCM and KLME are more efficient than the Galerkin PCE approach. While the computational efforts are greatly reduced compared to the direct sampling Monte Carlo method, the PCM and KLME approaches are able to accurately estimate the statistical moments and probability density function of the hydraulic head.},

We offer heuristics for addressing issues that arise in this formulation, and we apply the approach to a CFD-based airfoil shape optimization problem.

abstract = {We develop a multi-element generalized polynomial chaos (ME-gPC) method for arbitrary probability measures and apply it to solve ordinary and partial differential equations with stochastic inputs. Given a stochastic input with an arbitrary probability measure, its random space is decomposed into smaller elements. Subsequently, in each element a new random variable with respect to a conditional probability density function (PDF) is defined, and a set of orthogonal polynomials in terms of this random variable is constructed numerically. Then, the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) method is implemented element-by-element. Numerical experiments show that the cost for the construction of orthogonal polynomials is negligible compared to the total time cost. Efficiency and convergence of ME-gPC are studied numerically by considering some commonly used random variables. ME-gPC provides an efficient and flexible approach to solving differential equations with random inputs, especially for problems related to long-term integration, large perturbation, and stochastic discontinuities.},

abstract = {A new methodology, the Unrestricted Wind Farm Layout Optimization (UWFLO), that addresses critical aspects of optimal wind farm planning is presented in this paper. This methodology simultaneously determines the optimum farm layout and the appropriate selection of turbines (in terms of their rotor diameters) that maximizes the net power generation. The farm layout model obviates traditional restrictions imposed on the location of turbines. A standard analytical wake model has been used to account for the velocity deficits in the wakes created by individual turbines. The wind farm power generation model is validated against data from a wind tunnel experiment on a scaled down wind farm. Reasonable agreement between the model and experimental results is obtained. The complex nonlinear optimization problem presented by the wind farm model is effectively solved using constrained Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). It is found that an optimal combination of wind turbines with differing rotor diameters can appreciably improve the farm efficiency. A preliminary wind farm cost analysis is performed to express the cost in terms of the turbine rotor diameters and the number of turbines in the farm. Subsequent exploration of the influences of (i) the number of turbines, and (ii) the farm land size, on the cost per Kilowatt of power produced, yields important observations. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Constantine2012,
abstract = {Multivariate global polynomial approximations - such as polynomial chaos or stochastic collocation methods - are now in widespread use for sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. The pseudospectral variety of these methods uses a numerical integration rule to approximate the Fourier-type coefficients of a truncated expansion in orthogonal polynomials. For problems in more than two or three dimensions, a sparse grid numerical integration rule offers accuracy with a smaller node set compared to tensor product approximation. However, when using a sparse rule to approximately integrate these coefficients, one often finds unacceptable errors in the coefficients associated with higher degree polynomials.By reexamining Smolyak's algorithm and exploiting the connections between interpolation and projection in tensor product spaces, we construct a . sparse pseudospectral approximation method that accurately reproduces the coefficients for basis functions that naturally correspond to the sparse grid integration rule. The compelling numerical results show that this is the proper way to use sparse grid integration rules for pseudospectral approximation. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Chowdhury2013,
abstract = {The development of large scale wind farms that can compete with conventional energy resources presents significant challenges to today's wind energy industry. A powerful solution to these daunting challenges can be offered by a synergistic consideration of the key design elements (turbine selection and placement) and the variations in the natural resource. This paper significantly advances the Unrestricted Wind Farm Layout Optimization (UWFLO) method, enabling it to simultaneously optimize the placement and the selection of turbines for commercial-scale wind farms that are subject to varying wind conditions. The advanced UWFLO method avoids the following limiting traditional assumptions: (i) array/grid-wise layout pattern, (ii) fixed wind condition, or unimodal and univariate distribution of wind conditions, and (iii) the specification of a fixed and uniform type of turbine to be installed in the farm. Novel modifications are made to the formulation of the inter-turbine wake interactions, which allow turbines with differing features and power characteristics to be considered in the UWFLO method. The annual energy production is estimated using the joint distribution of wind speed and direction. A recently developed Kernel Density Estimation-based model that can adequately represent multimodal wind data is employed to characterize the wind distribution. A response surface-based wind farm cost model is also developed and implemented to evaluate and favorably constrain the Cost of Energy of the designed farm. The selection of commercially available turbines introduces discrete variables into the optimization problem; this challenging problem is solved using an advanced mixed-discrete Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of this wind farm optimization methodology is illustrated by applying it to design a 25-turbine wind farm in N. Dakota. A remarkable improvement of 6.4{\%} in the farm capacity factor is accomplished when the farm layout and the turbine selection are simultaneously optimized. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

An intrinsically statistical approach is presented, and how the shortcomings of traditional optimizationmethods can be overcome is demonstrated.We discuss two algorithms.

abstract = {Gradient-enhanced Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) has received recent attention, in which the derivatives of a Quantity of Interest (QoI) with respect to the uncertain parameters are utilized to improve the surrogate approximation. Polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) are often employed in UQ, and when the QoI can be represented by a sparse PCE, ???1-minimization can identify the PCE coefficients with a relatively small number of samples. In this work, we investigate a gradient-enhanced ???1-minimization, where derivative information is computed to accelerate the identification of the PCE coefficients. For this approach, stability and convergence analysis are lacking, and thus we address these here with a probabilistic result. In particular, with an appropriate normalization, we show the inclusion of derivative information will almost-surely lead to improved conditions, e.g. related to the null-space and coherence of the measurement matrix, for a successful solution recovery. Further, we demonstrate our analysis empirically via three numerical examples: a manufactured PCE, an elliptic partial differential equation with random inputs, and a plane Poiseuille flow with random boundaries. These examples all suggest that including derivative information admits solution recovery at reduced computational cost.},

@article{Peherstorfer2016a,
abstract = {Estimating statistics of model outputs with the Monte Carlo method often requires a large number of model evaluations. This leads to long runtimes if the model is expensive to evaluate. Importance sampling is one approach that can lead to a reduction in the number of model evaluations. Importance sampling uses a biasing distribution to sample the model more efficiently, but generating such a biasing distribution can be difficult and usually also requires model evaluations. A different strategy to speed up Monte Carlo sampling is to replace the computationally expensive high-fidelity model with a computationally cheap surrogate model; however, because the surrogate model outputs are only approximations of the high-fidelity model outputs, the estimate obtained using a surrogate model is in general biased with respect to the estimate obtained using the high-fidelity model. We introduce a multifidelity importance sampling (MFIS) method, which combines evaluations of both the high-fidelity and a surrogate model. It uses a surrogate model to facilitate the construction of the biasing distribution, but relies on a small number of evaluations of the high-fidelity model to derive an unbiased estimate of the statistics of interest. We prove that the MFIS estimate is unbiased even in the absence of accuracy guarantees on the surrogate model itself. The MFIS method can be used with any type of surrogate model, such as projection-based reduced-order models and data-fit models. Furthermore, the MFIS method is applicable to black-box models, i.e., where only inputs and the corresponding outputs of the high-fidelity and the surrogate model are available but not the details of the models themselves. We demonstrate on nonlinear and time-dependent problems that our MFIS method achieves speedups of up to several orders of magnitude compared to Monte Carlo with importance sampling that uses the high-fidelity model only.},

@article{Fernandez-godino,
abstract = {Simulations are often computationally expensive and the need for multiple realizations, as in uncertainty quantification or optimization, makes surrogate models an attractive option. For expensive high-fidelity models (HFMs), however, even performing the number of simulations needed for fitting a surrogate may be too expensive. Inexpensive but less accurate low-fidelity models (LFMs) are often also available. Multi-fidelity models (MFMs) combine HFMs and LFMs in order to achieve accuracy at a reasonable cost. With the increasing popularity of MFMs in mind, the aim of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art of MFM trends. For this purpose, publications in this field are classified based on application, surrogate selection if any, the difference between fidelities, the method used to combine these fidelities, the field of application and the year published. Available methods of combining fidelities are also reviewed, focusing our attention especially on multi-fidelity surrogate models in which fidelities are combined inside a surrogate model. Computation time savings are usually the reason for using MFMs, hence it is important to properly report the achieved savings. Unfortunately, we find that many papers do not present sufficient information to determine these savings. Therefore, the paper also includes guidelines for authors to present their MFM savings in a way that is useful to future MFM users. Based on papers that provided enough information, we find that time savings are highly problem dependent and that MFM methods we surveyed provided time savings up to 90{\%}.

abstract = {In the present study, the placement of wind turbines in wind farm has been resolved with a new coding and also a novel objective function in Genetic algorithm approach. In comparison to previous works, the results have been noticeably improved. The presented objective function, with its adjustable coefficients, provides more control on the cost, power, and efficiency of wind farm in comparison with earlier objective functions. Furthermore, in earlier jobs it was required to consider some subpopulations as well as individuals. However, there is no need to use the subpopulations in recent research by applying new coding approach in solving this problem. Therefore, running genetic algorithm only once for each case is sufficient. In this approach, three cases are considered (a) unidirectional uniform wind, (b) uniform wind with variable direction, and (c) non-uniform wind with variable direction. In Case (a), 10 individuals evolve over 150 generations. Case (b) has 20 individuals evolve for 150 generations. Case (c) starts with 20 individuals evolve for 100 generations. In addition to optimal configurations, results include fitness, total power output, efficiency of output power, number of turbines and objective function coefficients for each configuration. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Efron2004,
abstract = {The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets, Forward Selection and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on the basis of the same set of data to which the model will be applied. Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a C p estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

abstract = {The main objective of the study was to investigate spatial and temporal characteristics of the wind speed and direction in complex terrain that are relevant to wind energy assessment and development, as well as to wind energy system operation, management, and grid integration. Wind data from five tall meteorological towers located in Western Nevada, USA, operated from August 2003 to March 2008, used in the analysis. The multiannual average wind speeds did not show significant increased trend with increasing elevation, while the turbulence intensity slowly decreased with an increase were the average wind speed. The wind speed and direction were modeled using the Weibull and the von Mises distribution functions. The correlations show a strong coherence between the wind speed and direction with slowly decreasing amplitude of the multiday periodicity with increasing lag periods. The spectral analysis shows significant annual periodicity with similar characteristics at all locations. The relatively high correlations between the towers and small range of the computed turbulence intensity indicate that wind variability is dominated by the regional synoptic processes. Knowledge and information about daily, seasonal, and annual wind periodicities are very important for wind energy resource assessment, wind power plant operation, management, and grid integration.},

abstract = {The accuracy and the computational efficiency of a Point-Collocation Non-Intrusive Polynomial Chaos (NIPC) method applied to stochastic problems with multiple uncertain input variables has been investigated. Two stochastic model problems with multiple uniform random variables were studied to determine the effect of different sampling methods (Random, Latin Hypercube, and Hammersley) for the selection of the collocation points. The effect of the number of collocation points on the accuracy of polynomial chaos expansions were also investigated. The results of the stochastic model problems show that all three sampling methods exhibit a similar performance in terms of the the accuracy and the computational efficiency of the chaos expansions. It has been observed that using a number of collocation points that is twice more than the minimum number required gives a better approximation to the statistics at each polynomial degree. This improvement can be related to the increase of the accuracy of the polynomial coefficients due to the use of more information in their calculation. The results of the stochastic model problems also indicate that for problems with multiple random variables, improving the accuracy of polynomial chaos coefficients in NIPC approaches may reduce the computational expense by achieving the same accuracy level with a lower order polynomial expansion. To demonstrate the application of Point-Collocation NIPC to an aerospace problem with multiple uncertain input variables, a stochastic computational aerodynamics problem which includes the numerical simulation of steady, inviscid, transonic flow over a three-dimensional wing with an uncertain free-stream Mach number and angle of attack has been studied. For this study, a 5th degree Point-Collocation NIPC expansion obtained with Hammersley sampling was capable of estimating the statistics at an accuracy level of 1000 Latin Hypercube Monte Carlo simulations with a significantly lower computational cost.},

abstract = {We consider the question of whether Gauss quadrature, which is very famous, is more powerful than the much simpler Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature, which is less well-known. Seven-line MATLAB codes are presented that implement both methods, and experiments show that the supposed factor-of-2 advantage of Gauss quadrature is rarely realized. Theorems are given to explain this effect. First, following Elliott and O'Hara and Smith in the 1960s, the phenomenon is explained as a consequence of aliasing of coefficients in Chebyshev expansions. Then another explanation is offered based on the interpretation of a quadrature formula as a rational approximation of {\$}\backslashlog((z+1)/(z-1)){\$} in the complex plane. Gauss quadrature corresponds to Pad$\backslash$'e approximation at {\$}z=\backslashinfty{\$}. Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature corresponds to an approximation whose order of accuracy at {\$}z=\backslashinfty{\$} is only half as high, but which is nevertheless equally accurate near {\$}[-1,1]{\$}.},

abstract = {In many situations across computational science and engineering, multi-ple computational models are available that describe a system of interest. These different models have varying evaluation costs and varying fidelities. Typically, a computationally expensive high-fidelity model describes the sys-tem with the accuracy required by the current application at hand, while lower-fidelity models are less accurate but computationally cheaper than the high-fidelity model. Outer-loop applications, such as optimization, inference, and uncertainty quantification, require multiple model evaluations at many different inputs, which often leads to computational demands that exceed available resources if only the high-fidelity model is used. This work surveys multifidelity methods that accelerate the solution of outer-loop applications by combining high-fidelity and low-fidelity model evaluations. The overall premise of these multifidelity methods is that low-fidelity models are lever-aged for speedup while the high-fidelity model is kept in the loop to establish accuracy and/or convergence guarantees. We categorize multifidelity meth-ods according to three classes of strategies: adaptation, fusion, and filtering.

abstract = {This report reviews the available literature on the aerodynamics of wind turbines and wind farms. Firstly, two introductory chapters are devoted to the physics of the flow around a wind turbine and the existing engineering models for blade and wake aerodynamics. The focus of this work is however on the numerical modeling of wakes. The difficulties in solving the Navier-Stokes equations are discussed, and the different existing models for the description of the rotor and the wake are mentioned, along with problems associated with the choice of turbulence models and inflow conditions. The purpose of this overview is to include the latest developments in the numerical computation of wind turbine aerodynamics.},

abstract = {Three engineering wake models are compared with power production data from the Horns Rev and Lillgrund offshore wind farms. Single and multiple wake cases are investigated to verify the performance of the models in different conditions. The simulations reveal that the three wake models have similar behaviours for both wind farms although the turbine spacing and the turbulence intensity are different. The results prove the robustness of the models to provide accurate power predictions when the simulations are averaged over wind direction sectors of 30◦. However, all models significantly underpredict the power production of a single row of wind turbines using narrow sectors of 3◦ or 5◦. This discrepancy is discussed and justified by the wind direction uncertainty included in the datasets.},

When tailoring the orthogonal polynomial bases to match the forms of the input uncertainties in a Wiener-Askey scheme, excellent conver- gence properties can be achieved for general probabilistic analysis problems. Non-intrusive PCE methods allow the use of simulations as black boxes within UQ studies, and involve the calculation of chaos expansion coefficients based on a set of response function evalua- tions. These methods may be characterized as being either Galerkin projection methods, using sampling or numerical integration, or regression approaches (also known as point col- location or stochastic response surfaces), using linear least squares. Numerical integration methods may be further categorized as either tensor product quadrature or sparse grid Smolyak cubature and as either isotropic or anisotropic. Experience with these approaches is presented for algebraic and PDE-based benchmark test problems, demonstrating the need for accurate, efficient coefficient estimation approaches that scale for problems with significant numbers of random variables.},

However, the methods we have for analyzing and propagating epistemic uncertainty are not as nearly widely used or well-understood as methods to propagate aleatory uncertainty (e.g. inherent variability characterized by probability distributions). In this paper, we examine three methods used in propagating epistemic uncertainties: interval analysis, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, and second-order probability. We demonstrate examples of their use on a problem in structural dynamics, specifically in the assessment of margins. In terms of new approaches, we examine the use of surrogate methods in epistemic analysis, both surrogate-based optimization in interval analysis and use of polynomial chaos expansions to provide upper and lower bounding approximations. Although there are pitfalls associated with surrogates, they can be powerful and efficient in the quantification of epistemic uncertainty.},

abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated exciting potential for wind plant control systems to improve the cost of energy of wind plants. Wind plant controls seek to improve global wind plant performance over control systems in which each turbine optimizes only its individual performance by accounting for the way wind turbines interact through their wakes. Although these technologies can be applied to existing wind plants, it is probable that the maximum benefit would be derived by designing wind plants with these capabilities in mind. In this paper, we use system engineering approaches to perform coupled wind plant controls and position layout optimizations of a model wind plant. Using several cost metrics, we compare the results of this optimization to the original plant and to plants in which the control or layout is optimized separately or sequentially. Results demonstrate that the benefit of this coupled optimization can be substantial, but it depends on the particular constraints of the optimization.},

@article{Kennedy2001,
abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

abstract = {This report describes the development of a fast and reasonably accurate model for the prediction of energy production in offshore wind farms taking wake effects into account. The model has been implemented as a windows application called Fuga which can run in batch mode or as a graphical user interface. Fuga is briefly described. The model is based on alinearization technique which is described in some detail, and linearized, governing equations are derived and written in a standard form based on a mixed–spectral formulation. A new solution method is used to solve the equations which involves intensive use of look–up tables for storage of intermediate results. Due to the linearity of the model, multiple wakes from many turbines can be constructed from the wake of a single, solitary turbine. These are in turn constructed from Fourier components by a fast Fourier integral transform of results derived from generic look–up tables. Three different models, based on three different closures, are examined: • the 'simple closure' using an unperturbed eddy viscosity $\kappa$u∗z • the mixing length closure • the E–$\epsilon$ closure Model results are evaluated against offshore wind farm production data from Horns Rev I and the Nysted wind farm, and a comparison with direct wake measurements in an onshore turbine (Nibe B) is also made. A very satisfactory agreement with data is found for the simple closure. The exception is the near wake, just behind the rotor, where all three linearized models fail. The mixing length closure underestimates wake effects in all cases. The E–$\epsilon$ closure overestimates wake losses in the offshore farms while it predicts a too shallow and too wide the wake in the onshore case. The simple closure performs distinctly better than the other two. Wind speed data from the the Horns rev met masts are used to further validate Fuga results with the 'simple' closure. Finally, R{\o}dsand 1 and 2 are used as an example to illustrate the interaction between wind farms.},

abstract = {Non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and stochastic collocation (SC) meth- ods are attractive techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) due to their strong math- ematical basis and ability to produce functional representations of stochastic variability. PCE estimates coefficients for known orthogonal polynomial basis functions based on a set of response function evaluations, using sampling, linear regression, tensor-product quadra- ture, or Smolyak sparse grid approaches. SC, on the other hand, forms interpolation functions for known coefficients, and requires the use of structured collocation point sets derived from tensor-products or sparse grids. When tailoring the basis functions or inter- polation grids to match the forms of the input uncertainties, exponential convergence rates can be achieved with both techniques for general probabilistic analysis problems. In this paper, we explore relative performance of these methods using a number of simple alge- braic test problems, and analyze observed differences. In these computational experiments, performance of PCE and SC is shown to be very similar, although when differences are evident, SC is the consistent winner over traditional PCE formulations. This stems from the practical difficulty of optimally synchronizing the form of the PCE with the integration approach being employed, resulting in slight over- or under-integration of prescribed ex- pansion form. With additional nontraditional tailoring of PCE form, it is shown that this performance gap can be reduced, and in some cases, eliminated.},

abstract = {Polynomial chaos (PC) expansions are used in stochastic finite element analysis to represent the random model response by a set of coefficients in a suitable (so-called polynomial chaos) basis. The number of terms to be computed grows dramatically with the size of the input random vector, which makes the computational cost of classical solution schemes (may it be intrusive (i.e. of Galerkin type) or non intrusive) unaffordable when the deterministic finite element model is expensive to evaluate.To address such problems, the paper describes a non intrusive method that builds a sparse PC expansion. First, an original strategy for truncating the PC expansions, based on hyperbolic index sets, is proposed. Then an adaptive algorithm based on least angle regression (LAR) is devised for automatically detecting the significant coefficients of the PC expansion. Beside the sparsity of the basis, the experimental design used at each step of the algorithm is systematically complemented in order to avoid the overfitting phenomenon. The accuracy of the PC metamodel is checked using an estimate inspired by statistical learning theory, namely the corrected leave-one-out error. As a consequence, a rather small number of PC terms are eventually retained (sparse representation), which may be obtained at a reduced computational cost compared to the classical " full" PC approximation. The convergence of the algorithm is shown on an analytical function. Then the method is illustrated on three stochastic finite element problems. The first model features 10 input random variables, whereas the two others involve an input random field, which is discretized into 38 and 30 - 500 random variables, respectively. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Xiu2005,
abstract = {Recently there has been a growing interest in designing efficient methods for the solution of ordinary/ partial differential equations with random inputs. To this end, stochastic Galerkin methods appear to be superior to other nonsampling methods and, in many cases, to several sampling methods. However, when the governing equations take complicated forms, numerical implementations of stochastic Galerkin methods can become nontrivial and care is needed to design robust and efficient solvers for the resulting equations. On the other hand, the traditional sampling methods, e. g., Monte Carlo methods, are straightforward to implement, but they do not offer convergence as fast as stochastic Galerkin methods. In this paper, a high-order stochastic collocation approach is proposed. Similar to stochastic Galerkin methods, the collocation methods take advantage of an assumption of smoothness of the solution in random space to achieve fast convergence. However, the numerical implementation of stochastic collocation is trivial, as it requires only repetitive runs of an existing deterministic solver, similar to Monte Carlo methods. The computational cost of the collocation methods depends on the choice of the collocation points, and we present several feasible constructions. One particular choice, based on sparse grids, depends weakly on the dimensionality of the random space and is more suitable for highly accurate computations of practical applications with large dimensional random inputs. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the stochastic collocation methods.},

abstract = {We discuss the arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC), which has been subject of research in a few recent theoretical papers. Like all polynomial chaos expansion techniques, aPC approximates the dependence of simulation model output on model parameters by expansion in an orthogonal polynomial basis. The aPC generalizes chaos expansion techniques towards arbitrary distributions with arbitrary probability measures, which can be either discrete, continuous, or discretized continuous and can be specified either analytically (as probability density/cumulative distribution functions), numerically as histogram or as raw data sets. We show that the aPC at finite expansion order only demands the existence of a finite number of moments and does not require the complete knowledge or even existence of a probability density function. This avoids the necessity to assign parametric probability distributions that are not sufficiently supported by limited available data. Alternatively, it allows modellers to choose freely of technical constraints the shapes of their statistical assumptions. Our key idea is to align the complexity level and order of analysis with the reliability and detail level of statistical information on the input parameters. We provide conditions for existence and clarify the relation of the aPC to statistical moments of model parameters. We test the performance of the aPC with diverse statistical distributions and with raw data. In these exemplary test cases, we illustrate the convergence with increasing expansion order and, for the first time, with increasing reliability level of statistical input information. Our results indicate that the aPC shows an exponential convergence rate and converges faster than classical polynomial chaos expansion techniques. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This includes a detailed discussion on how to account for design uncertainties and how to measure robustness (i.e., how to evaluate robustness). The main focus will be on the different approaches to perform robust optimization in practice including the methods of mathematical programming, deterministic nonlinear optimization, and direct search methods such as stochastic approximation and evolutionary computation.

abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the process of determining the effect of input uncertainties on response metrics of interest. These input uncertainties may be characterized as either aleatory uncertainties, which are irreducible variabilities inherent in nature, or epistemic uncertainties, which are reducible uncertainties resulting from a lack of knowledge. When both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties are mixed, it is desirable to maintain a segregation between aleatory and epistemic sources such that it is easy to separate and identify their contributions to the total uncertainty. Current production analyses for mixed UQ employ the use of nested sampling, where each sample taken from epistemic distributions at the outer loop results in an inner loop sampling over the aleatory probability distributions. This paper demonstrates new algorithmic capabilities for mixed UQ in which the analysis procedures are more closely tailored to the requirements of aleatory and epistemic propagation. Through the combination of stochastic expansions for computing statistics and interval optimization for computing bounds, interval-valued probability, second-order probability, and DempsterShafer evidence theory approaches to mixed UQ are shown to be more accurate and efficient than previously achievable. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recently, the use of Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) has been increasing to study the uncertainty in mathematical models for a wide range of applications and several extensions of the original PCE technique have been developed to deal with some of its limitations. But as of to date PCE methods still have the restriction that the random variables have to be statistically independent. This paper presents a method to construct a basis of the probability space of orthogonal polynomials for general multivariate distributions with correlations between the random input variables. We show that, as for the current PCE methods, the statistics like mean, variance and Sobol' indices can be obtained at no significant extra postprocessing costs. We study the behavior of the proposed method for a range of correlation coefficients for an ODE with model parameters that follow a bivariate normal distribution. In all cases the convergence rate of the proposed method is analogous to that for the independent case. Finally, we show, for a canonical enzymatic reaction, how to propagate experimental errors through the process of fitting parameters to a probabilistic distribution of the quantities of interest, and we demonstrate the significant difference in the results assuming independence or full correlation compared to taking into account the true correlation.},

To create the model, we obtained some broad design information from the published documents of turbine manufacturers, with a heavy emphasis on the REpower 5M machine. Because detailed data was unavailable, however, we also used the publicly available properties from the conceptual models in the WindPACT, RECOFF, and DOWEC projects. We then created a composite from these data, extracting the best available and most representative specifications. This report documents the specifications of the NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine—including the aerodynamic, structural, and control-system properties—and the rationale behind its development. The model has been, and will likely continue to be, used as a reference by research teams throughout the world to standardize baseline offshore wind turbine specifications and to quantify the benefits of advanced land- and sea-based wind energy technologies.},

abstract = {The wake of a wind turbine operating in an atmospheric turbulent inflow without mean shear is simulated using a numerical method, which combines large eddy simulations with an actuator line technique. A turbulent inflow with the same spectral characteristics as the atmosphere is produced by introducing time varying body forces in a plane upstream the rotor. The results of the simulation are compared to those obtained on a wind turbine in uniform inflow at the same mean wind speed and from this comparison a number of features of the influence of inflow turbulence on wake dynamics are deduced. Furthermore, the results are used to verify the validity of some of the basic assumptions employed in simpler engineering models and to study their bounds of application. The large amount of data from the wake simulation can easily be used in simple engineering methods to model a wind turbine operating in the wake of an upstream turbine},

abstract = {Researchers within the International Energy Agency (IEA) Task 31: Wakebench have created a framework for the evaluation of wind farm flow models operating at the microscale level. The framework consists of a model evaluation protocol integrated with a web-based portal for model benchmarking (www.windbench.net). This paper provides an overview of the building-block validation approach applied to wind farm wake models, including best practices for the benchmarking and data processing procedures for validation datasets from wind farm SCADA and meteorological databases. A hierarchy of test cases has been proposed for wake model evaluation, from similarity theory of the axisymmetric wake and idealized infinite wind farm, to single-wake wind tunnel (UMN-EPFL) and field experiments (Sexbierum), to wind farm arrays in offshore (Horns Rev, Lillgrund) and complex terrain conditions (San Gregorio). A summary of results from the axisymmetric wake, Sexbierum, Horns Rev and Lillgrund benchmarks are used to discuss the state-of-the-art of wake model validation and highlight the most relevant issues for future development.},

abstract = {Wind is one of the most promising sources of alternative energy. The construction of wind farms is destined to grow in the U.S., possibly twenty-fold by the year 2030. To maximize the wind energy capture, this paper presents a model for wind turbine placement based on the wind distribution. The model considers wake loss, which can be calculated based on wind turbine locations, and wind direction. Since the turbine layout design is a constrained optimization problem, for ease of solving it, the constraints are transformed into a second objective function. Then a multi-objective evolutionary strategy algorithm is developed to solve the transformed bi-criteria optimization problem, which maximizes the expected energy output, as well as minimizes the constraint violations. The presented model is illustrated with examples as well as an industrial application. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many multivariate functions in engineering models vary primarily along a few directions in the space of input parameters. When these directions correspond to coordinate directions, one may apply global sensitivity measures to determine the most influential parameters. However, these methods perform poorly when the directions of variability are not aligned with the natural coordinates of the input space. We present a method to first detect the directions of the strongest variability using evaluations of the gradient and subsequently exploit these directions to construct a response surface on a low-dimensional subspace---i.e., the active subspace---of the inputs. We develop a theoretical framework with error bounds, and we link the theoretical quantities to the parameters of a kriging response surface on the active subspace. We apply the method to an elliptic PDE model with coefficients parameterized by 100 Gaussian random variables and compare it with a local sensitivity analysis method for dimension reduction.},

We employ a novel methodology based on active subspaces to characterize the effects of the input uncertainty on the scramjet performance. The active subspace identifies one-dimensional structure in the map from simulation inputs to quantity of interest that allows us to reparameterize the operating conditions; instead of seven physical parameters, we can use a single derived active variable. This dimension reduction enables otherwise infeasible uncertainty quantification, considering the simulation cost of roughly 9500 CPU-hours per run. For two values of the fuel injection rate, we use a total of 68 simulations to (i) identify the parameters that contribute the most to the variation in the output quantity of interest, (ii) estimate upper and lower bounds on the quantity of interest, (iii) classify sets of operating conditions as safe or unsafe corresponding to a threshold on the output quantity of interest, and (iv) estimate a cumulative distribution function for the quantity of interest.},

abstract = {Average power losses due to wind turbine wakes are of the order of 10 to 20{\%} of total power output in large offshore wind farms. Accurately quantifying power losses due to wakes is, therefore, an important part of overall wind farm economics. The focus of this research is to compare different types of models from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to wind farm models in terms of how accurately they represent wake losses when compared with measurements from offshore wind farms. The ultimate objective is to improve modelling of flow for large wind farms in order to optimize wind farm layouts to reduce power losses due to wakes and loads. The research presented is part of the EC-funded UpWind project, which aims to radically improve wind turbine and wind farm models in order to continue to improve the costs of wind energy. Reducing wake losses, or even reduce uncertainties in predicting power losses from wakes, contributes to the overall goal of reduced costs. Here, we assess the state of the art in wake and flow modelling for offshore wind farms, the focus so far has been cases at the Horns Rev wind farm, which indicate that wind farm models require modification to reduce under-prediction of wake losses while CFD models typically over-predict wake losses. Further investigation is underway to determine the causes of these discrepancies. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {This thesis concerns the axisymmetric actuator disc model and its extension to a three di- mensional actuator line technique which, combined with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, are applied to describe the aerodynamics of wind turbine rotors. The developed methods are used to investigate the aerodynamic behaviour of coned rotors, rotors exposed to yawed inflow and tunnel blockage. Miscellaneous investigations are conducted in order to analyze the consistence of some basic assumptions of the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) method, such as the influence of pressure on expanding streamtubes and the accuracy of tip correction theories. In thelatter case an inverseformulationof the equationswere applied. Results for the coned rotor demonstrates that the Navier-Stokes methods, both the actuator disc and actuator line, captures the changed aerodynamic flow behaviour whereas a modified BEM method is incapable of handling flow through coned rotors. For rotors exposed to yawed inflow, the actuator disc method combined with appropriate sub models predicts structural loads with good accuracy. At high yaw angles the actuator line method capture observed effects from the root vortex, which axisymmetric methods is incapable of. Computations on rotors inserted into a tunnel show that the Navier-Stokes methods fully resolve the effects of tunnel blockage. A new solution to the inviscid axial momentum analysis on tunnel blockage by Glauert, is also presented. The new solution compares excellent with results presented for the equivalent free air speed obtained with the Navier-Stokes methods. An analysis of pressure forces acting on expanding the streamtubes revealed that the influence of pressure forces is negligible for the velocities at the rotor disc. A new approach to solve the heavily loaded actuator disc is presented, using a new numerical technique based on solving the equations original formulated by Wu. The formulations is fast to run on computer, however, less accurate than Navier-Stokes computations. A new method for inverse determination of the tip-correction factor is believed to be correct, however, the obtained results reveal uncertainties which needs further investigations.},

Thus, the choice of optimization algorithm is critical, as it directly affects the number of required design evaluations to reach the optimum design. To help designers make an informed choice, we benchmark several optimization algorithms, including gradient-based and gradient-free methods using three test problems of increasing difficulty: a multi-dimensional Rosenbrock function, a RANS-based aerodynamic twist optimization problem and an aerodynamic shape optimization problem. The majority of the gradient-based optimizers successfully solved all three test problems, while the gradient-free methods require two to three orders of magnitude more computational effort when compared to the gradient-based methods. Thus, gradient-based algorithms are the only viable option for solving large-scale aerodynamic design optimization problems.},

abstract = {Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods have proved highly effective for solving constrained optimization problems with smooth nonlinear functions in the objective and constraints. Here we consider problems with general inequality constraints (linear and nonlinear). We assume that first derivatives are available and that the constraint gradients are sparse.We discuss an SQP algorithm that uses a smooth augmented Lagrangian merit function and makes explicit provision for infeasibility in the original problem and the QP subproblems. SNOPT is a particular implementation that makes use of a semidefinite QP solver. It is based on a limited-memory quasi-Newton approximation to the Hessian of the Lagrangian and uses a reduced-Hessian algorithm (SQOPT) for solving the QP subproblems. It is designed for problems with many thousands of constraints and variables but a moderate number of degrees of freedom (say, up to 2000). An important application is to trajectory optimization in the aerospace industry. Nume...},
