abstract = {For von Karman-Trefftz profiles, the characteristics which determine profile shape (profile nose dimensions, maximum thickness and position: tail slope and curvature) are stated as a function of transformation variables using the Timman method. The profile is obtained by iterative deformation of a von Karman profile with known transformation, corresponding as well as possible to the desired profile. The figures and relations which enable a good choice of the required profile are given.},

abstract = {An investigation of a large group oj related, airfoils was made in the N.A.O.A. variable-density wind tunnel at a large value oj the Reynolds Number. The tests were made to provide data that may be directly employedfor a rational choice of the most suitable airfoil section for a given application. The variation of the aerodynamic characteristics with variations in thickness and meanAine form were therefore systematically studied. The related airfoil profiles for this investigation were developed by combining certain profile thickness forms, obtained by varying the maximum thickness of a basic distribution, with certain mean lines, obtained by varying the length and the position of the maximum mean-line ordinate. A number of values of these shape variables were used to derive afamily of airfoils. For the purposes of this investigation the construction and tests were limited to 68 airfoils of this family. In addition to these, several supplementary airfoils have been, included in order to study the effects of certain other changes in the form of the mean line and in the thickness distribution. The results are presented in the standard graphic form representing the airfoil characteristics for infinite aspect rath and for aspect ratio 6. A table is also given by means of which the important characteristics of all the airfoils may be conveniently compared. The variation of the aerodynamic characteristics with changes in shape is shown by additional curves and tables. A comparison is made, where possible, with thin-airfoil theory, a summary of which is presented in an appendix.},

@article{Kulfan2006,
abstract = {The mathematical description of a nacelle, body or airfoil having a round nose and pointed aft-end is a continuous but non-analytic function because of the infinite slope at the nose and the corresponding large variations of curvature over the surface. Consequently, a large number of coordinates are typically required to describe the geometry. The general mathematical formulation necessary to describe an airfoil, axisymmetric body or nacelle, is defined in order to develop a "fundamental" geometric transformation technique. This method includes the introduction of a simple analytic and well behaved "shape function" that describes the geometry. The "shape function" provides the ability to directly control key geometry parameters such as leading edge radius, trailing edge boattail angle, and closure to a specified aft thickness. A "class function" is defined that generalizes the method for a wide variety of geometries. The "shape function" and "class function" methodology provides a unified approach for describing rather arbitrary 2D and 3D geometries. Examples of using this approach to produce a variety of 2D and 3D geometries are shown to illustrate the versatility of this new methodology.},

@article{Hicks1978,
abstract = {A study was conducted to assess the feasibility of performing computerized wing design by numerical optimization. The design program combined a full potential, inviscid aerodynamics code with a conjugate gradient optimization algorithm. Three design problems were selected to demonstrate the design technique. The first involved modifying the upper surface of the inboard 50{\%} of a swept wing to reduce the shock drag subject to a constraint on wing volume. The second involved modifying the entire upper surface of the same swept wing (except the tip section) to increase the lift-drag ratio subject to constraints on wing volume and lift coefficient. The final problem involved modifying the inboard 50{\%} of a low-speed wing to achieve good stall progression. Results from the three cases indicate that the technique is sufficiently accurate to permit substantial improvement in the design objectives.},
