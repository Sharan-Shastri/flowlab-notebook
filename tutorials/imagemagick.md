# Creating .gif Animations with imagemagick
#### PJ Stanley

imagemagick is a program that can take individual pictures (frames) that you generate and turn them into an animated .gif file. Here are some quick tips and flags when using the program that will hopefully make your experience easier.

### Installation

For a Mac you can just use brew to install: ```brew install imagemagick```
When I installed there were quite a few dependencies that I didn't have, so it took a while to install.

### Generating your frames

The first time I used imagemagick was to display turbine design and locations at each iteration of an optimization. I used pyplot to create each frame, and here are a few pointers that would have saved me a lot of time had I known them at the beginning.
